# wordlists

This is an attempt to collect, de-duplicate, and normalize as many useful wordlists I
could find, while avoiding the ones that were blindly generated without much review.

...and various other things I found interesting, like phrases, possibly password lists later.
A few of them are mine, most are not.

Thanks to many other collectors, enthusiats, security sites, linguist hobbyists, and many more before me.


## Encoding

Various lists I found used an ASCII-safe coding of non-ASCII characters, or used codepages.

An attempt was made to make this all UTF-8. Where the coding is known to be unknown, it's marked with .decodeme, I should get to it eventually.

These were translated to be the actual characters and encoded in UTF-8, but since not all of them are languages I speak or understand well enouh,
there are no guarantees that is all correct. 


## Attribution

Where wordlists had initial comments, those are left in. 
   ...so when loading them, you may want to ignore initial lines starting with #, which is the usual way to put in comments.

I will try to note the origin (the name should be a hint at least), but there are plenty of wordlists that I cannot find the origin of.

I assume these are usable without getting into trouble. Unless mentioned otherwise.
But don't incorporate them into anything serious without checking the legalities.
Just saying.

There are othes that are clearly part of copyrighted software. 
I try to avoid them, but if you own the copyright for any and feel this is infringing, drop me a line, and I will try to link to them instead.



## Similarities

YAWL, SOWPODS, and TWL06 are very smilar lists (90+% overlap)
